        <p class="author" alignment="left">EnFab works on the model of evolving the fashion industry. Our agenda to make a change in the way people relate to fashion. Rather than being just a symbol of status we aspire to make it a symbol of identity and awareness. We believe in
        </p>
        <b class="author" ><br><br>“YOU ARE WHAT YOU WEAR”
        </b>
        <p class="author">In this generation, every piece of clothing is attached to not only the look or the comfort it provides but also with sentiments. The consciousness about personalization is now turning fashion into a form of art  but this is being misused in numerous ways by false claims and biased beliefs resulting the in division of our society. To lead this art in the right way and to the maximum and the healthiest of it’s benefits, EnFab was found.</p>
        <b class="author" ><br>“ENFAB & NATURE”
        </b><p class="author">Simply because of lack of knowledge and unmet demands, people are unconsciously neglecting the nature. Conscious shopping is now made easier with Enfab. No more worries about how you may be supporting global warming or your wardrobe landslides by just buying a new shirt .because we are here to buy your worries and plant hope with every purchase.<br>We can proudly say that we use not even 1 fabric that is harming the fauna or the eco system. Every fabric is selected after a deep research about it’s contribution to mother Earth and a wide variety of fabrics like recycled polyester, organic cotton , woocoa , tencel etc. having eco frndly and deeply desired properties are there to be chosen from.

        <b class="author" ><br>“HE CAN DO WHAT HE WILLS, BUT HE CANNOT WILL WHAT HE WILLS” – ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER</b>
        <p class="author">A fash brand may not skyrocket only on the principles of the Holy Land .At the end of the day, fashion is about meeting the growing demand of customers. Without neglecting any of your requests, we not only provide you with affordability, comfort, trendiest designs and adaptability, but we also allow you to purchase upcycled clothing for your pets at a subsidised rate! After all they are the ones who make you smile at your lowest.

        <b class="author" ><br>“ BY CONVENTION SWEET AND BY CONVENTION SOUR AND BY CONVENTION , MAY I ADD , EQUAL”
        </b>
        <p class="author">At EnFan - trust, hard work, and evolution top the list of priority  even before financial growth and we therefore boost ethnic , cultural , gender neutral , religious and many more clothing too! From kirtan to quran, from folk dance to pride parade we have it all! 
        <br>We all rose from this land, grew on this land and shall one day submerge into this land then who are we to discriminate between the communities and ideologies who have grown from the same sacred adobe? EnFab is proud to be originated from a country of extensive diversities for that is it’s beauty. Each and every thought , feeling , realization and belief has the right to  be expressed and shared equally and what can be more of an exposure than being able to freely manifest .</p>
        <b class="author" ><br>“I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE HAPPIEST LIFE, BUT I CAN GO TO MY GRAVE PEACEFULy AS LONG AS I  KNOW-
          <br>I MADE SOMEONE’S LIFE BETTER ”</b>
        <p class="author">The best organisations consider not only their brand, consumers, and stakeholders, but also their employees, who are the unsung heroes behind the scenes. EnFab strives to be synonymous with the greatest sustainable brand, thus we cherish our employees and workers and provide them with the recognition and support they deserve.
        <br><br>Being an independent company, our brand is standing on the pillars of our workers who put on every inch of precision they have. Every product is a manifestation of their love and turmoil. To recognise this, we are not just evaluating their expertise or employing staff who have long been interested in this piece of art, but we are also initiating a movement to offer them credit and much needed assistance (more info on the “one more thread oh hope”)
